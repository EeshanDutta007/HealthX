1. Soham Sakaria :- -> Edit Readme of this github repo -> Login/Register Page -> Data base to store the login id of patient -> symptoms page and calculate percentage

2. Parth Pandey :- -> Diet and Excercise part -> Add in features on a separate page about food info and food used to avoid breast cancer -> Excercise tips only in a single page -> help sakaria with the login page -> symptoms page with illustrations

3. Parth Srivastava :- //chat application details eeshan ke saath discuss karlena -> joint work in chat application with eeshan -> symptoms page with illustrations -> showing of sections of medicine and tests to be done (more ellaboration later)

4. Eeshan Dutta :- -> Edit Readme of this github repo -> chat application -> uploading image with filter part for storing in the prescription -> About in the app

Note :-
1. All illustrations needs to be first passed by the team and then added
2. Main colour of the app is pink (all shades cool) 
3. Probabilty calculator needs to discussed upon as to how we planning to do those as there can be a number of ways in doing so and I cannot estimate the load of the work.
4. This is a very vague and rough division but we will discuss the flow of the app

FEATURES OF THE APP :- 
1. Have a Symptoms page which states the symptoms of breast cancer of both male and female. It also has a prediction model which takes in the symptoms of a person(who is not yet      diagnosed with breast cancer) and gives the probability of the person having breast cancer or not.
2. Have a common chat group which helps connect people/patients with doctors and vice versa and have a conversation about various problems/solutions related to breast cancer.        Image upload feature is also there which makes it more efficient for doctor to get Xrays/prescription from the patients and give their valuable advice to the patient in chat      box.
3. Have a Diets and Exercise page which publishes the foods that one must eat and avoid and the excercises one must do to reduce the chances of having breast cancer or for the        knowledge of the people already suffering from it/or in early stages.
4. Have an About page which gives a short description about our app and what it strives to provide for helping the community in little ways possible and also a small bio about us    developers.
